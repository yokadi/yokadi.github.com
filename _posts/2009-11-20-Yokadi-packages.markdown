Some nice people make very good work to make software easily usable by everyone: packagers. We are very
pleased to announce that Yokadi is packaged for all major Linux Distribution (Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Slackware, SuSe...)
and for OpenBSD.

[Grab it](/download.html), and start getting organized!

title: Yokadi 1.3.0 has been released
author: Aurelien

In June I got a bug report about [Yokadi being broken in Debian Trixie](https://github.com/agateau/yokadi/issues/67), the upcoming version of Debian. Turns out SQL Alchemy 1.4 is no longer packaged, replaced by SQL Alchemy 2.0, which is not supported by Yokadi 1.2.0. I spent a bit of time to port to SQL Alchemy 2.0, modernized a few things on the way (that code base is starting to show its age!), made one (1) visible change and released 1.3.0!

Here is the complete changelog:

- Yokadi has been updated to SQLAlchemy 2.0.32.
- `t_list` now uses color to display keywords.
- Fixed the crash handler failing on Windows.

As usual, you can install it with `pipx install yokadi` or download an archive from the [download page](/download.html).
